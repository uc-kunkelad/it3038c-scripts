# Python Arrow

The following documentation represents 3 of many uses for the Arrow plugin for Python. Arrow is used to format time and date information which can be so tedious within many programming languages. This will be done in a virtual environment. Start by creating the virtual environment with the commands below.

virtualenv ~/venv/arrow

This vitual environment will now be activated.

source ~/venv/arrow/bin/activate

Now that our virtual environment is setup, we can add the plugin without affecting our server.

pip3 install arrow
